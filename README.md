# lstm_in_the_unet

This is a real-time speech enhancement model which consists of unet & lstm.
Most parts of this code came from DTLN(Nils L. Westhausen).
But model structure are completely different and some loss functions which have higher performance are implemented.
And you can get some intuition related with post training integer quantization.
